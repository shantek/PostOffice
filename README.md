### Post Office is a fully functional Minecraft Post Office plugin for your Bukkit based Minecraft servers.

Show your support for the Plugin via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=9N3RCSJF6PYPU) or [Patreon](https://shantek.co/patreon).

With built-in post box protection, you can rest easy knowing your post boxes are safe on your Minecraft SMP.

Players are unable to break a post box or sign unless they have the correct permission node allowing them to do so.

Available now on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/postoffice), [CurgeForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/post-office/) and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/post-office.108343/).

## How does the plugin work?

- Upload the JAR to your server and reboot
- Rename barrels in an anvil to "pobox" - if you want to use a different name, be sure to change this in the config and use /postoffice reload to update your config file.
- Place your barrels in your amazing Post Office build.
- Place a sign on the front of the barrel and type the barrel owners name on the second line, this then becomes the owner of the post box.
- Enjoy your awesome post office on your SMP!
