## How does the plugin work?

- Upload the JAR to your server and reboot
- Rename barrels in an anvil to "pobox" - if you want to use a different name, be sure to change this in the config and use /postoffice reload to update your config file.
- Place your barrels in your amazing Post Office build.
- Place a sign on the front of the barrel and type the barrel owners name on the second line, this then becomes the owner of the post box.
- Enjoy your awesome post office on your SMP!
